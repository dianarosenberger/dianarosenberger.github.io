There are three things I want to discuss in regards to what I’ve read in Wendy Chung so far:

1)	Software and writing
2)	Software and metaphor
3)	Software and neoliberalism

1)	This is a continuation of my question from last week on Hodge: if media has “noise,” doesn’t writing also have “noise”? By noise, I mean what Shannon thinks of as the “incapacity to transmit.” I know Scott encouraged us to think of “finitude” instead of “noise.” But my main concern is that writing is, after all, material. It can be messy, it can make mistakes, it can miscommunicate. Chung seems to agree that software can do this too. In the introduction, she states, “although information is often considered to be immaterial, the forces behind copyrighting (and taxing) software stress the fact that, regardless of information’s ephemerality, information is always embodied; it always . . . leaves a trace” (5). Chung goes on to dispute Galloway’s contention that code always does what it says it does. She claims this idea “both separates instruction source code and execution, between instruction and result” (22). In other words, as we all very well know, just because “know” code does not mean we will be able to properly “execute” it. The way we “interpret” the code, or put it together, always leaves a fundamentally human trace.
