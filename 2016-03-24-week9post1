These readings certainly covered a lot. There are two main things I want to talk about here:

1)	invisibility
2)	“authenticity” (yes, I have to put this in quotes, because who knows what this means really?)

1)	I want to push back on this notion of invisibility a little bit. [Joe](http://joetorok.github.io/blog/2016-03-23/hardware.html) mentions in his blog how Nakamura discusses the “erasing or making opaque the labor that affords ‘innovation and development.’” The thing that’s a little confusing about Nakamura’s argument is that she problematizes *both* the Navajo’s invisibility *as well as* how they are made visible. The way the Navajo are portrayed, especially in the Shiprock brochure, is littered with racial stereotypes. Fairchild is appropriating an image here - playing up ideas of Native Americans as dexterous craftspeople, who, after centuries of weaving blankets, are only naturally disposed to making circuit breakers – *for the benefit of the corporation*. In other words, the Navajo are *only* made visible when it makes someone else – Fairchild, the military, the U.S. government – look good. A kind of selective invisibility perhaps. But even “true” invisibility – a “labor temporally hidden” or “hidden spatially” (937) – doesn’t feel exactly right. It’s not that we don’t know that the [coltan in our phones comes from the Congo (Nathaniel)](http://nattybee.github.io//blog/2016-03-23/compression.html) or that [our clothes are made in sweatshops in Indonesia (Todd)](http://tbreijak.github.io/blog/2016-03-23/Corporate-Exploitation-in-Nakamura.html). It’s that we actively *choose* not to think about this fact. I’d like it if one of these authors tackled what the conditions are surrounding this sort of unthinkability. Is this way of thinking a hangover from colonialism (as in, I don’t concern myself with what’s going on *over there*)? Or is there something recent, something about the integrality of technology that makes it different, that makes this turning away possible? 

2)	Like [Nathaniel](http://nattybee.github.io//blog/2016-03-23/compression.html) and [Aden](http://adenj86.github.io/blog/2016-03-23/Uneven-Development-and-Bootleg-Aesthetics.html), I also thought about *Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story* when reading Sterne. Nathaniel, I would also distrust a bluray of this film. There’s something about the grainy quality that makes the film feel “authentic.” But what is authenticity here? Especially when “lo-fi” becomes an aesthetic *choice* rather than inherent to the infrastructure itself (Nathaniel’s [Jack White example](ttp://nattybee.github.io//blog/2016-03-23/compression.html) is a good one). There’s a quote I’m thinking of from Tan Lin's *Heath Course Pak* - a book [Kelly](http://kellypolasek.github.io/) and I recently read in Barrett’s class - something about “distortion being built into the product” in order to make it feel more “natural.” We know what this feels like; people can look weirdly *unnatural* on televisions that are too hi-def. But it’s hard to determine what the starting point is for the natural/the authentic/verisimilitude (defined, by the way, as the “merely appearance of truth”). Should I think about visual media best “represents” what I see in my real life? Is the most “true” auditory media the one that’s closest to what I hear during a live music performance? And how can we even track this when the “finitude” of the medium so often surpasses the “finitude” of the human eye/ear?
